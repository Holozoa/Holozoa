Hello there and welcome gits
its @Holozoa
I like to scrap business computers and use them as servers
I focus on code that is system agnostic, configurable, and low maintenance
I try to rely on foss and selfhosted software stacks, it's all for fun so usability be damned 
I like working on anything someone finds useful, but I'm on a ricing binge so really into streamlining front end environments atm
You can find out more at holozoa.github.io and I prefer contact through holozoa@protonmail.me
